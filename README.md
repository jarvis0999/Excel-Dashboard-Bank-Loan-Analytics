#Problem Statement:

The current loan data analysis approach lacks depth and interactivity, impeding the extraction of meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Conventional reporting methods fail to offer a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. Therefore, there is a critical necessity for advanced dashboard development to overcome these limitations and fully leverage the potential of our loan data.

Objective:

Our objective is to develop a suite of interconnected dashboards that provide dynamic and comprehensive insights into our loan data, empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence derived from rigorous data analysis. These dashboards are meticulously designed to offer a holistic perspective on our lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, facilitating strategic decision-making based on data-driven insights.

Dashboard : Executive Summary(Excel)

Purpose:

This dashboard offers an overview of critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating the overall efficiency and performance of our lending activities.

Key Features:

Total Loan Applications: Monitor total and Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, scrutinizing Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for actionable insights.

Total Funded Amount: Evaluate the cumulative disbursed funds and track MTD disbursements, analyzing MoM variations to discern funding patterns.

Total Amount Received: Assess cash inflows via total and MTD received amounts from borrowers, scrutinizing MoM fluctuations for financial health assessment.

Average Interest Rate: Determine the cost of lending by computing and tracking the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD and MoM changes.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate borrowers' financial resilience by calculating the average DTI for all loans and monitoring MTD and MoM changes.

Loan Performance Analysis:

Classify loans into "Good" and "Bad" categories based on specific KPIs such as application percentages, funded amounts, and received amounts.

Implement a "Loan Status Grid View" for detailed categorization by loan status, providing insights into various metrics to support data-driven decision-making.
